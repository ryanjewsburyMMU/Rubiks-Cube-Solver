Lets say you don't have a webcam, or you completed the cube scanning, only to notice one colour out of place. This
is where edit mode comes in.

With edit mode, you can draw your physical cube, digitally using the user friendly UI, this can be used after a scan,
to fix any potential wrongly identified colours, or to build your cube from scratch.

The only warning would be to make sure you hold your cube correctly when you start drawing - ideally as it is shown
on screen. For example, you want to have the white face, facing you - and the orange face pointing upwards.

How to use?

1). Enter Edit Mode by clicking the appropriately named button.

2). Click on your desired colour, from the bottom right.

3). With this colour selected, click on any of the cubies to change its colour (Note: you cannot change centre pieces)

4). Once complete, leave edit mode before attempting to solve - this will validate your cube.
