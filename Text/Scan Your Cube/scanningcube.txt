With this program, you can scan your own cube.
In order to understand how to use the scanner, I will quickly explain what a cube 'Face' is, as this is referred to
alot in the program (more on this in Cube Notation Tab)

The center piece of any face on the cube, is how the entire face is referred too.For example, on any scrambled cube
face, the center points will always stay the same, with there only being one of each colour, on each of the 6 sides.

If you would like to find the white face, rotate the cube until you see the White center piece. This is the white face.

The cube scanner will not let you scan any other face, aside from the one it is asking for.

In order to use the scanner, you press 'SPACEBAR' to scan the face, and 'ENTER' to submit the scan.
