The step by step solve will provide you with each individual step (based on my solving method) to solving the cube,
it will also give you the real world equivalent of each cube notation - for example "F" = "Front Face Right".

This is a great way to make a move on your cube, check to see whether it is correct and move onto the next.

The next way of solving is using the Full Solve - this provides the full solve all at once (Solve Cube Button)

When you click this, the entire cube will (digitally) solve. The solving algorithm will then appear in the listbox,
( image below ), you can then look at each step, only given the notation. This will help improve your solving ability,
and also your ability to read and understand notation - this is aimed at more advanced users to follow along with.
