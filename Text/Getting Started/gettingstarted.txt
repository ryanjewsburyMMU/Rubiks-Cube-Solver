Welcome to my Rubik's Cube Solver! If this is your first time using this program, there are a few things you might want
know before getting started.

Firstly across the top of this page, you can see five different tabs, each referring to a different aspect of this program,
with which you can then choose how you would like to use it. I recommend familiarising yourself with Cube Notation,
as this program is heavily based around this notation, and is integral to understanding how the program works.

With this program you can:

A). Scan Your Own Cube, using your webcam using 'Scan Cube'

B). Draw Your cube digitally using 'Enter Edit Mode'

C). Play around, using random scrambles, and making moves using Cube Notation

D). Challenge yourself to solve the cube using step-by-step solve to check your progress
