As with any algorithm, it is essentially a set of moves, that when executed achives a task. This is the same for
cube algorithms. These algorithms will be a concatenation of different cube notation, that moves the cube in a specific
way, to formulate different shapes, designed to build the cube up in order to solve it.

Here is an example of the cube notation used in this program
