What is the development folder?

The development folder is where I keep track of all files that are now deprecated.

In this you can see the earlier stages of development through the project by seeing the first working versions of:
- Cube Solver
- Cube Scanner
- GUI

All of these had obvious flaws, but acted as the building blocks to aid with the completion of this project.

Please note these files are not commented, and have not been refactored.
