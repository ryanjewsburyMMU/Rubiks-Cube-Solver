Notes:

Not detecting yellow / white on startup...

Implementaion of openccv works

HOWEVER

We need to adjust the order so that it falls in coreect format...
cube seems to be creating string wrong....


It currently does not.

TODO:
- Comment All Code
- Do ALOT of testing
- Try and give incorrect cubes  - test stability of error detection
- Possibly Add simple timer - if time superpasses 15 seconds, alert user and error has occured.
- Make becca able to understand messagebox, then anyone will
- Remove X Y and M from scrambles
- Implement x2 values ("R2, L2")

-- Scramble Optimiser?



R Ui F L B D

SOMETHING HAPPENED WRONG

double look over white cross
algorithm not working as expected...


# Notes
----------------------------------
OpenCV window did not close
with the addition of
--
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
for i in range(1, 5):
    cv2.waitKey(1)
--
It closes fine.

    # Search current_cube for a particular index
    current_cube.get_piece(-1,1,-1).colors[0]

    Returns:
    'G'

    colourFromLetter( current_cube.get_piece(-1,1,-1).colors[0]  )

    Returns:
    Green

    # We can then set the colour of green_00 to Green using the tag green_00 and itemconfigure

    cubeCanvas.itemconfigure(green_00, fill=colourFromLetter(current_cube.get_piece(-1, 1, -1).colors[0]))
