Notes:

Not detecting yellow / white on startup...

Implementaion of openccv works

HOWEVER

We need to adjust the order so that it falls in coreect format...
cube seems to be creating string wrong....


It currently does not.

TODO:
- Comment All Code
- Do ALOT of testing
- Try and give incorrect cubes  - test stability of error detection
- Possibly Add simple timer - if time superpasses 15 seconds, alert user and error has occured.
